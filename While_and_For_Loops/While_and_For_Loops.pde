//if (x < width) {
  //does sth
  //can happen or not happen

//2 kinds of loop: while and for

// while (x < width) {...}
//can happen to infinity

//for loop = shorthand for while loop
//example

//int x = 0;
//while (x < width) {   //boolean expression
// line (x,0,x,height);
// x = x + 20;      //incrementation
//}
//the for loop for thhis would be..
//for (int x = 0; x < width ; x = x+20){
//  line (x, 0, x, height);
//}

//loop must always have an exit condition, otherwise it is infinite
